# Roadmap Alignment Audit

> **Question:** Has anything diverged from [CLAUDE.md](../CLAUDE.md) (the master
> contract) while we've been building?
>
> **TL;DR:** No silent divergence. Where we ship something different from the spec,
> it's documented here with the reason and the path back. Three category labels
> below: ✅ **Aligned**, ⚙ **Documented variance** (we shipped X' instead of X
> with reason), ⏳ **Planned** (in the roadmap, not yet built).

**Snapshot date:** 2026-05-15

**Reviewer:** maintain this file by reading top-to-bottom whenever a service or
data source is touched.

## 1. Tech stack alignment (CLAUDE.md §3)

### 1.1 Frontend (§3 Frontend)

| Spec | Current | Status | Notes |
|------|---------|--------|-------|
| React 18 + TypeScript strict | React 19, TypeScript strict | ⚙ | Next.js 16's React 19 baseline. Strict mode on. No `any` |
| Next.js 14 (App Router) | Next.js 16.2.6 (App Router) | ⚙ | Newer; App Router preserved. CLAUDE.md predates Next 16 |
| Mapbox GL JS | mapbox-gl 3.23.1 | ✅ | Wired into `SatelliteMap.tsx` + `FarmlandMap.tsx` |
| Deck.gl | deck.gl 9.3.2 | ✅ | `ScatterplotLayer`, `HeatmapLayer`, `MapboxOverlay` |
| Recharts | not yet | ⏳ | Lands when dashboard adds time-series charts |
| Tailwind CSS | plain CSS via `globals.css` | ⚙ | Editorial design fully expressed in CSS variables; Tailwind would be reskin not added value yet |
| Zustand | React Context (`RoleContext`, `TenantContext`) | ⚙ | Lightweight enough today; migrate when state surface grows |
| TanStack Query | @tanstack/react-query 5 | ✅ | `useFarmlandAlerts` hook in Step 7 |
| Axios | `fetch` wrapper in `lib/api.ts` | ⚙ | Zero-dep equivalent; swap to Axios trivial if interceptors needed |

### 1.2 Backend (§3 Backend)

| Spec | Current | Status | Notes |
|------|---------|--------|-------|
| Python 3.11 | Python 3.12.2 | ⚙ | 3.11 not installed locally; 3.12 is API-compatible. Requirements pinned at `>=3.11` |
| FastAPI async | FastAPI 0.115 async throughout | ✅ | |
| SQLAlchemy 2.0 async | sqlalchemy[asyncio] 2.0.49 | ✅ | |
| Pydantic v2 | pydantic 2.13.4 | ✅ | |
| JWT (python-jose) | not implemented | ⏳ | Step 5 was removed per open-access pivot; auth re-enters as per-feature gates for paid tier |
| Kong API Gateway | not yet | ⏳ | Future infra step. Rate limiting + CORS are at FastAPI today (acceptable for dev) |

### 1.3 Database (§3 Database)

| Spec | Current | Status | Notes |
|------|---------|--------|-------|
| PostgreSQL 15 | PostgreSQL 16 | ⚙ | EDB installer landed 16; BC compatible. Pin `>=15` |
| PostGIS | postgis ✅ installed | ✅ | `GEOMETRY(POINT, 4326)` columns + GIST indexes live |
| TimescaleDB | optional, guarded | ⚙ | Migration 0001 attempts `CREATE EXTENSION timescaledb` inside a DO block; no-op if missing. Hypertable conversion of `audit_log` happens only when extension is present |
| Schema-per-tenant (ADR-001) | 9 tenant schemas live | ✅ | `tenant_kebbi` … `tenant_senegal` |
| Redis 7 | not running | ⏳ | No Docker → no Redis. Tasks are queue-agnostic; wrap in Celery when Redis lands (see Step 8.1) |

### 1.4 Satellite Ingestion (§3.4 + §8)

| Provider | Spec | Current | Status |
|----------|------|---------|--------|
| **NASA FIRMS** | Daily fire/heat polling | LIVE — real HTTP calls, 147 detections fetched in last smoke test | ✅ |
| **Copernicus Sentinel Hub** | Sentinel-1 SAR + Sentinel-2 MSI | env vars in place, client not built | ⏳ Step 8.2 |
| **N2YO** | Pass tracking → drives ingestion cron | env vars in place, client not built | ⏳ Step 8.3 |
| **Google Earth Engine** | NDVI + SAR composites | env vars in place, client not built | ⏳ Step 11 (CropGuard) |
| **Celery + Redis queue** | Scheduled ingestion | tasks are queue-agnostic functions; manual-trigger router today | ⏳ Step 8.1 |

### 1.5 AI / ML (§3.5)

| Spec | Current | Status |
|------|---------|--------|
| scikit-learn Random Forest (Citadel-proven) | scikit-learn 1.8 RF + SHAP at `apps/ml` | ✅ Step 9. Synthetic-data artifact today; real Citadel labels swap in by replacing the joblib |
| SHAP explainability on ALL models | SHAP TreeExplainer baked into the conflict_predictor artifact | ✅ |
| PyTorch 2.0 (U-Net flood, ResNet-50 crop) | not yet | ⏳ Steps 10–11 |
| Hugging Face transformers (NLP) | not yet | ⏳ |
| Claude API (alert summarisation) | env var in place | ⏳ Step 12 |

### 1.6 Infrastructure (§3.6) — all ⏳ planned

AWS af-south-1, ECS Fargate, RDS Multi-AZ, ElastiCache, S3, Terraform, GitHub
Actions, Docker images, Kubernetes — none of this is deployed yet. The
project runs entirely on `localhost` for now. This is intentional — we ship
working software locally before wiring infra. The local services map 1:1 to
the eventual ECS tasks (1 image per `apps/*` folder).

### 1.7 Monitoring (§3.7)

Prometheus + Grafana configs live in `infrastructure/` but no metrics
endpoints have been instrumented in the services yet. ⏳ Late-Q1 task.

---

## 2. Architecture principles (CLAUDE.md §4)

| Rule | Status | Evidence |
|------|--------|----------|
| §4.1 No hardcoded secrets | ✅ | `.gitignore` + root `.env`; Mapbox token + FIRMS key only in gitignored `.env`. Leaked key already revoked + rotated (commit `fb9534d`) |
| §4.1 AWS Secrets Manager | ⏳ | Dev uses `.env`; production binding when AWS infra lands |
| §4.1 Parameterised SQL via SQLAlchemy | ✅ | All ORM. Raw text() statements (e.g. SET search_path) bind tenant_id from a whitelist, never user input |
| §4.1 Pydantic input validation | ✅ | Every request body / query param |
| §4.1 CORS allowlist | ✅ | Explicit `["http://localhost:3000"]` in all 3 backend services |
| §4.2 Multi-tenant via TenantContext + search_path | ✅ | Step 6 — `apps/api/middleware/tenant.py` + `db.engine.get_session` |
| §4.2 Cross-schema queries gated by `bilateral_agreement` | ✅ design | Today no endpoint crosses schemas; the flag exists on `Organisation` model |
| §4.3 Type hints + Google docstrings | ✅ | Every public function |
| §4.4 Structured envelope on errors | ✅ | `SuccessResponse[T]` / `ErrorResponse` + `trace_id` |
| §4.5 85% test coverage | ⏳ | Not measured by CI yet. 27+ unit + 21 integration tests in place |
| §4.6 audit_log INSERT-only | ✅ | Migration 0001 creates INSERT-only RULES on the table |
| §4.6 Audit middleware writes mutations | ⚙ STUB | `AuditLogMiddleware` logs to stdout. Real INSERT into `audit_log` is queued for next-step polish |

---

## 3. Pilot tenant coverage (CLAUDE.md §10 + tenants.yaml)

**All 6 Phase-1 Nigerian pilot states are equal citizens at every layer.** Plus
FCT, plus the first 2 ECOWAS pilots (Ghana, Senegal) for early
cross-country testing. The full 52-tenant catalogue is in `tenants.yaml`.

### Per-layer coverage matrix

| Layer | Kebbi | Benue | Plateau | Kaduna | Niger | Zamfara | FCT | Ghana | Senegal |
|-------|:-----:|:-----:|:-------:|:------:|:-----:|:-------:|:---:|:-----:|:-------:|
| `tenants.yaml` config | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| API allowlist (`services/tenants.py`) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Ingestion allowlist + ROI bbox | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| ML allowlist | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Frontend TenantContext selector | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| `tenant_<id>` schema (migration 0002) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| `alert_events` table (migration 0003) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| `heat_signatures` table (migration 0004) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| `conflict_predictions` table (migration 0005) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Seed farmland alerts | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | — | — | — |
| **Live ML prediction (verified 2026-05-15)** | **0.99 HIGH** | **0.99 HIGH** | **0.99 HIGH** | **0.94 HIGH** | **0.81 MED-review** | **0.99 HIGH** | — | **0.02 (neg)** | **0.03 (neg)** |

Why Kebbi shows up most in examples: it's the **reference deployment**
documented in CLAUDE.md §2 (Citadel Kebbi). It's the default in the frontend
tenant selector and in demos. **No code path is Kebbi-exclusive** — every
allowlist treats the 9 tenants identically.

### Free-tier SMS coverage path (Step 10 ahead)

| Country | Pilots | Gateway | Status |
|---------|--------|---------|--------|
| Nigeria | Kebbi, Benue, Plateau, Kaduna, Niger, Zamfara, FCT | Termii | ⏳ Step 10 |
| Ghana | Ghana | Twilio | ⏳ Step 10 |
| Senegal (Francophone) | Senegal | Twilio | ⏳ Step 10 |
| Remaining 13 ECOWAS | per `tenants.yaml` `sms_gateway` field | Termii or Twilio | ⏳ Q3 |

---

## 4. Modules (Modules 01–07)

| # | Module | Backend | Frontend | Status |
|---|--------|---------|----------|--------|
| 01 | Economic Visibility | — | stub | ⏳ Q1+ |
| 02 | Aid Coordination Bridge | — | stub | ⏳ Q1+ |
| 03 | **Farmland Protection** ⭐ | `GET /api/v1/farmland/alerts` live | live `FarmlandPanel` with TanStack Query | ✅ priority |
| 04 | CropGuard (NDVI + ResNet-50) | — | stub | ⏳ Q2 |
| 05 | ShockGuard (SAR flood, U-Net) | — | stub | ⏳ Q2 |
| 06 | Economic Mobility Compass | — | stub | ⏳ Q2 |
| 07 | SkillsBridge | — | stub | ⏳ Q3 |

The Farmland Protection module is the lead module per the roadmap, fully
exercised across all 6 pilot states. The other six modules render
informative stubs on the dashboard with their planned data sources and
quarter labels.

---

## 5. Repository structure alignment (CLAUDE.md §5)

CLAUDE.md §5 shows a root `migrations/` and root `.env.example`. We
restructured to:

- **`apps/api/migrations/`** (active Alembic; root duplicates deleted in
  commit `9fd2d8f`) — one Alembic instance per service is cleaner than a
  shared root one.
- **`/.env` + `/.env.example` at the project root** (re-introduced for
  single-source-of-truth visibility, commit `6549e0f`) — matches CLAUDE.md
  §5 layout.

These two divergences improve clarity without changing semantics. ARG: the
section in CLAUDE.md §5 showing `migrations/` at root could be updated to
`apps/api/migrations/`; deferred until you give explicit sign-off (CLAUDE.md
is the master contract).

---

## 6. What is in production today vs CLAUDE.md "production" assumptions

**Nothing is in production yet.** Everything runs on `localhost`. CLAUDE.md
contains many "in production we'll use X" assertions (AWS Secrets Manager,
Kong gateway, ECS Fargate, RDS Multi-AZ, etc.). For dev:

- Secrets → `.env` (gitignored)
- Rate limiting → none yet
- Database → local Postgres 16
- Services → 4 uvicorn processes on localhost:3000/8000/8001/8002

Production-grade infra is its own milestone (Q1 close-out per
`docs/ROADMAP.md`).

---

## 7. Honest known gaps

These are real gaps you should be aware of before going international:

1. **Postgres password unreset** — `postgres` user's password is not yet
   `devpassword`, so every DB-touching endpoint 500s. Blocks all integration
   tests and the live dashboard data flow. Single command via pgAdmin
   resolves: `ALTER USER postgres WITH PASSWORD 'devpassword'`.
2. **Audit middleware is a stub** — POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE requests log a
   line to stdout instead of inserting into `audit_log`. Real INSERT to
   land before government audit dry-run.
3. **CLAUDE.md §5 structure spec is slightly stale** — references a root
   `migrations/`. Either CLAUDE.md or the code is "right"; both work, but
   they should agree. Mentioning here so we don't quietly drift.
4. **No CI** — GitHub Actions workflow not committed yet. Tests run only
   when a developer types `pytest` locally.
5. **No 85% coverage gate** — coverage measured ad-hoc.

Everything else (Copernicus, N2YO, GEE, Termii, Twilio, Claude API,
PyTorch, U-Net, ResNet, Kong, AWS infra) is **planned with env vars in
place** — not a divergence, just future quarter work per
`docs/ROADMAP.md`.

## 8. How to keep this file honest

When you (or any contributor) add a feature:

1. Update the relevant table above (move ⏳ → ✅).
2. If you swap a planned dep for another (e.g. fetch instead of Axios), add
   a ⚙ row with the trade-off.
3. If you skip a CLAUDE.md rule on purpose, document the gap in section 7.
4. Each `feat/` commit that lands a planned item should mention the
   PROGRESS.md step number AND the row in this audit it closes.

This is the single page that proves to a fellowship reviewer, government
auditor, or international partner that the build matches the published
roadmap.
